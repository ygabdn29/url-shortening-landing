## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- I think the way I handle adding shortened link to the page and how I handle the error message can be improved
- Adding more breakpoint so that the design more responsive to more resolution
